## Introduction

Hello everyone! I’d like to share the story of how my team and I spent three whirlwind months launching a startup, pivoting repeatedly, and ultimately signing our very first client. Our venture started out broad—like many do—but we soon realized the importance of zeroing in on a specific problem. In our case, that meant creating a software solution integrated with **LINE Official Account** to help enterprises automate their communication workflows using AI. Here’s the rundown of what we learned along the way.

## 1. The Power of Niche Markets

When we initially kicked off our project, we assumed casting a wide net would maximize our chances of success. We dreamed of building a massive, all-encompassing platform. Reality soon set in: generalist solutions are tough to stand out in a saturated market.

### Why You Shouldn’t Go Too Broad

The social-media and online-communities space is notoriously competitive, with only a handful of new platforms managing to break through each year. The real opportunities often lie in solving targeted problems for specific audiences.

1. **Play to Your Strengths**: Reflect on the unique skills or resources you bring to the table.
2. **Focus on One Core Audience**: Understand their challenges deeply and develop solutions that resonate directly with their pain points.

### The Pivots That Led Us Here

We ended up pivoting four times. Our earliest concept revolved around consumer-facing edu-tech, only to realize that businesses had more urgent communication needs that weren’t being met efficiently. So we started building an AI-driven workflow automator—specifically tailored to LINE Official Account—for enterprises needing to streamline conversations with vendors and customers. It was a major shift, but each pivot helped us peel back another layer of insight into what the market genuinely needed.

> **YC Mantra Reminder:** “Do things that don’t scale.” Even if your solution isn’t fully polished yet, get it in front of real users to validate.

## 2. Start with a Proof of Concept (PoC)

It’s easy to fall into the trap of building an entire MVP based on your own assumptions. We made that mistake early on. Only after holding countless interviews did we realize our MVP wasn’t targeting the users’ actual pain points.

### Interviewing to Uncover Real Problems

**Why interview?** Because assumptions rarely paint the full picture. By conducting open-ended conversations with potential users, you’ll learn what truly matters to them. Our interviews taught us that enterprises needed a more efficient way to communicate with hundreds of vendors and customers—especially in markets where LINE is the main communication channel.

1. **Find a Focused Group**: Talk to specific teams or departments rather than “everyone.”
2. **Learn How They Spend Their Day**: Understand their routine and see where tasks become painfully repetitive.
3. **Identify the Most Pressing Pain Points**: Don’t just ask—watch how they work. The real pain points often reveal themselves in the smallest details. So, start with an open question and then dig deeper.
4. **Propose a Straightforward Solution**: Validate your idea by getting initial reactions and feedback.

> **YC Mantra Reminder:** “Build something people want.” Interviews are the easiest way to confirm you’re on the right track.

## 3. Craft a Minimalistic MVP

After refining our concept, we discovered that manually contacting vendors took up a disproportionate amount of time for many enterprises. Sending repetitive messages to hundreds of vendors via email or phone was cumbersome. We realized we could integrate AI-driven automation directly into LINE Official Account to handle these communications far more efficiently.

### Our MVP: AI + LINE Official Account

We built a lean feature that uses AI to automate vendor outreach within LINE. Instead of typing out individual messages or emails, our platform streamlined the process with just a few taps. This simple yet powerful approach drastically cut down the time employees spent on repetitive communication tasks. Our first paying client saw immediate value, and that sealed the deal.

## Conclusion

Launching a startup is exhilarating and exhausting in equal measure. There will be abrupt course corrections, dead ends, and sparks of clarity that finally click into place. In our case, it took three months—and four pivots—to land our first paying client. The secret? Focusing on one tangible pain point and validating our ideas through constant user feedback.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Narrow Your Audience**: A tight focus often resonates more than a generic approach.
2. **Validate Early**: Before sinking time into building, validate with potential users.
3. **Keep It Simple**: Solve one problem thoroughly rather than ten problems halfway.
