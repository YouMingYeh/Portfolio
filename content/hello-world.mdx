## Introduction

Hey everyone! I’m writing this to share my experience after three intense months of starting Adastra as a developer and student. The journey has been full of ups and downs, pivots, and countless interviews. But amidst the chaos, we finally found our first paying client. Here’s what I learned.

## 1. Narrow Down Your Niche

When we kicked off Adastra, our initial plan was to build a platform for _everyone_. We assumed that the bigger the market, the better our chances. Turns out that approach was misguided. The truth is, timing and specificity matter.

### Why Broad Isn’t Always Better

In recent years, new community or social media platforms have rarely taken off. The market is saturated. Instead, focusing on solving a well-defined problem for a specific group of people is far more effective.

1. **Know Your Strengths:** Ask yourself, “What can I build that others can’t, or at least can’t do easily?”
2. **Identify a Specific Audience:** Then create a solution that addresses their particular pain points.

### Learning Through Pivots

We pivoted four times. Initially, we targeted the consumer (to-C) edu-tech market, then switched to a business-facing (to-B) AI software solution. It was a major shift, but each pivot brought us closer to solving a real problem. There’s no single “right” or “wrong” path here—only ongoing learning.

## 2. Proof-of-Concept Comes Before MVP

Early on, we made the classic mistake of building an MVP purely based on our assumptions. We believed we knew the problem our audience faced. But after dozens of interviews, we realized our initial idea wasn’t the real pain point.

### Conduct Interviews First

**Why interview?** People often won’t articulate their pain points until you ask the right questions. Interviews and cold emails gave us the insight we needed to redefine our problem statement.

1. **Choose a Specific Niche** to talk to.
2. **Map Out Their Daily Tasks** to see where their time goes.
3. **Identify Pain Points** that are time-consuming or frustrating.
4. **Propose a Simple Technical Solution** that addresses those issues.

> **YC Mantra:** _“Build something people want.”_

## 3. Build the Simplest Possible MVP

After validating our idea through interviews, we discovered our target audience spent a huge chunk of time contacting vendors manually. Imagine taking 20 minutes to email each vendor, with hundreds of vendors to reach. That’s a massive time sink.

### Our MVP: AI-Driven Vendor Outreach

We built a straightforward feature: an AI-powered tool that automates vendor outreach. It cut the process down from 20 minutes per vendor to just a few clicks. Our first client absolutely loved it, and that’s how we landed our first deal.

## Conclusion

Entrepreneurship is both challenging and exciting. You’ll pivot, fail, learn, and pivot again. After three months of hustle, we finally signed our first client by focusing on a single, specific pain point and validating it with actual users.

**Key Takeaways**:

- Go niche. The broader your audience, the less focused your solution.
- Validate with interviews before building anything extensive.
- Keep your MVP as simple as possible; solve one core problem really well.

I hope this helps you avoid the mistakes we made. If you have any questions, drop them in the comments. Thanks for reading, and happy building!
